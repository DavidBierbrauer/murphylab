    "Program reads out the stored raw data of the textfiles saved in the database , extracts information and saves them in various tables. Capital `VARIABLES` are used to be stored in tables via pymsql. Lowercase variables are temporary helper variables.\n",
    "`trials` are single stimuli and their responses, `sessions` are (potential) headfix sessions, `videos` saves the base information (file names) about the video, `rewards` saves the water consumption and can be used for daily monitoring. `entries` describe everything between an entry and an exit, with one exeption:\n",
    "\n",
    "If headfix protocol is active and a mouse decides to stay for more than one session without leaving the chamber in between, another entry is statet when the next session begins. This is a necessary workaround to sum up what a mouse is doing with an entry.\n",
    "Absolute correct entry counts and durations, if really needed, can always be extracted from the raw data tables\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The program is based on the knowledge how a textfile will look like. Changes in the documentation that are saved in the textfiles will of course disturb this program ! So make sure that textfiles always use the same structure or adjust this program to your documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Here global variables and if conditions are used. It may seem like not the most elegant approach,\n",
    "but it is easy to read, easy to extend and also avoids mistakes. Mice do weird things and using too many loops might result in mistakes when executing the code.\n",

    "each day takes approximately 5-10 minutes. So running all data together will take a few days. Since we usually update daily this is not a big deal, but if needed this can be speed up by saving the data first in lists and then save them all together, e.g. daywise or keeping the database connection open (which gives rise to mistakes and makes the DB vulnerable, so it is not very recommended). Opening and closing the database connection consumes approximately 95-99% of the time. For direct databaseloggers of cages it is therefore also recommended to save all events first in lists or dataframes and then commit the whole list to the database at once when a mouse e.g. leaves the tunnel."
