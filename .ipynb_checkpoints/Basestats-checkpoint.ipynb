    "\n",
    "A good strategy is always to order the data we need first in a way we want to have it and then mine this new table how we want it. For example we want to have a value for daily headfixes and also for all headfixes. so it is best to first count it for each day and mouse, the `GROUP BY` command effects all kind of aggregation functions, like counts, sums, averages, std and so on. Then we use the new table to build averages for daily headfix counts and a sum for the overall headfixes.\n",
    "\n",
    "we use ``SUM(IF(`Trial or Entry` = \"fix\" ,1,NULL))`` to count all entries that lead to a heafixation first. The idea of the sum is that if condition in a row is fulfilled we add a 1 for this row, otherwise a NULL (or zero). Now we mine this new table and build averages, STDs or sums. If we use COUNT now on this table we will just count the number of rows in the new table. IF we use the COUNT(DISTINCT...) command we avoid that same rows are counted twice. We also count each day where we have at least something for an entry of `minutes headfixed` as a day with a headfixation.\n",
    "\n",
    "to get the success rate of the last 5 days we could potentially use SQL but this is actually a bit of a pain. In this case we would have to use two more layers of SELECTs (so basically mining our table and mining this mined table). Additionally it is not necessarily useful to add the very last day(s) because the mouse that stops potentially experiences something severe that causes it to stop. Except for the mice that are afraid of headfixing right from the beginning the stopping might be a very personal process with very individual circumstances. We saw for example mice that stoped after long power outs, because they realized that they will get additional water. Others maybe got frustrated by the increasing difficulty of the task (delay time training) and stop after 2 or 3 days of trying. Usually the last day is significantly worse in success ratio and is not representive and should potentially be excluded. Therefore the best approach might be here to just bin the success rates by day and have a look at the last days and then process this further either by python with a fancy algorithm or just manually e.g. in MS excel if the mice counts are not too big.
